# directoryWebsite
Website project to provide a directory of permaculture resources<br>
Aim is to gather links to all the scattered resources, on the web and in print, and host them on one searchable website<br>
Another goal is to have a custom search option where, given parameters of your location's climate, you are given livestock and produce options that would best suit your region.<br>
It's a big project, and currently this repository will just hold the basic HTML resource pages while I gather information, and eventually the CSS, Python, and (probably?)Django files that will bring them to life.
