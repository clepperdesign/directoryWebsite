        - accounts for things like use (eggs, meat, dairy, fur/leather), available space, climate, freerange ability, etc)    
    - plant finder for produce
        - similar to livestock, but focus on climate factors like usda zone, rainfall, soil type, available space, type of produce desired, etc
